# DefAI

Defy AI bots and provide dedicated content just for them.

> A WordPress plugin based on VolkswAIgen

You do not want AI to be trained on your content?

This plugin is the solution.

It checks each request coming in against a list of known AI-Training-Bots and
should the request come from one of them the get special content
but definitely not **your** content.

Currently the bots will be redirected to the OpenAI website
but that will be possible to change in future versions.

## Installation

Currently the plugin is in review by the WordPress plugin team.

Until it is available on the WordPress plugin-page you can download
the plugins ZIP-file attached to the
[latest release](https://github.com/VolkswAIgen/defai/releases/) and upload
that into your WordPress installation.

After that, you will have to activate the plugin.

That is all. From now on all known AI-bots will be redirected to the
OpenAI website.

## Configuration

Currently there is nothing to configure.

In a future version it will be possible to configure what
content the AI-bots will be fed.
